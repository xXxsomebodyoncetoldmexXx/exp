 ong:
    + pros:
      - can read the problem 
      - can implement easy problem fast (less bug time)
      - can implement ideas
      - can give ideas for solutions
      - less stress time
    + cons:
      - but sometime missing stuffs
      - stupid about math, graph
      - give complex ideas (and sometime stupid)

 Duck:
    + pros:
      - can also read the problems but more carefulness

      - the easier the problem, the more stress having thus missing the point of the problem
